# CS-6476 Python Notebooks [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/royNiladri/cv-followalong/HEAD)
This repository is intended for follow along with GA Tech OMSCS CS-6476 Computer Vision lectures. The lessons use Matlab or Octave, but I am using Python with OpenCV. To interact with the notebooks, click on the Binder badge.

## Getting started (Windows)
- Install Python 3.7 (OpenCV is currently not compatible with Python 3.8)
- Install Anaconda and open Navigator
- Create new Environment (from Environments tab)
- Add the following libraries:
  - numpy
  - opencv
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  
## Introduction
[Open Notebook](https://github.com/royNiladri/cv-followalong/blob/main/01_Introduction.ipynb)
- Read a image as colored image (read as BRG, not RGB)
- Read a image as grayscle
- Display color image (needs color conversion)
- Display gray scale image (needs cmap)
